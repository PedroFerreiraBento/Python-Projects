# Python Web Scraping Projects  

This folder contains a collection of Python projects focused on web scraping. These projects showcase different techniques and libraries for scraping data from websites, including Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium.

## Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.

If you’re scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you’re unlikely to have any problems. Still, it’s a good idea to do some research on your own and make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service before you start a large-scale project.
