This folder contains a collection of Python programming logic projects. These projects are designed to help you improve your understanding of programming concepts and practice your Python skills.

## List of Projects

Here are 12 projects included in this folder:

1. [**Simple Calculator**](1.1-simple-calculator/README.md) - A program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs a math operation chosen by the user (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

2. [**Guess the Number**](1.2-guess-the-number/README.md) - A program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number.

3. [**Unit Converter**](1.3-unit-converter/README.md) - A program that converts between different units of measure (e.g. from kilometers to miles).

4. [**Find the Largest Number**](1.4-find-the-largest-number/README.md) - A program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and then finds and displays the largest number.

5. [**Caesar Cipher Encryption**](1.5-caesar-cipher-encryption/README.md) - A program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher.

6. [**Number Sorting**](1.6-number-sorting/README.md) - A program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and then sorts the list in ascending or descending order.

7. [**Dice Rolling Simulation**](1.7-dice-rolling-simulation/README.md) - A program that simulates the rolling of one or more dice and displays the result.

8.  [**Password Generator**](1.8-password-generator/README.md) - A program that generates random passwords based on user preferences.

9.  [**Palindrome Checker**](1.9-palindrome-checker/README.md) - A program that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome (i.e. can be read the same way forwards and backwards).

10. [**Tic Tac Toe Game**](1.10-tic-tac-toe-game/README.md) - A tic tac toe game played by two players in the terminal.

11. [**Minesweeper Game**](1.11-minesweeper-game/README.md) - A minesweeper game played in the terminal.

12. [**Hangman Game**](1.12-hangman-game/README.md) - A hangman game played in the terminal.
